# 🌍 Global Tourism Statistics Data Warehouse

Welcome to the **Global Tourism Statistics Data Warehouse** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern data warehouse using **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**, applied to real-world datasets on global tourism and UN SDG indicators.  

It is built to showcase **Data Engineering, SQL Development, and Data Analytics** skills in a professional, portfolio-ready format.  

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The architecture follows the Medallion approach:  

![Data Architecture](docs/Data_Architecture.png)  

1. **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingested from CSV (UN Tourism Statistics + UN SDG datasets).  
2. **Silver Layer** → Cleaned, standardized, and normalized data, with null-handling and code mappings.  
3. **Gold Layer** → Business-ready data, organized into fact and dimension views (star schema).  

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

The data ingestion and transformation pipeline is structured as follows:  

![Data Flow](docs/Data_flow.png)  

- **Sources**: UN Tourism Statistics (domestic, inbound, outbound, industries) and SDG indicators (8.9.1, 8.9.2, 12.b.1).  
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw CSV imported into SQL Server with `BULK INSERT`.  
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaning, transformations, and standardization.  
- **Gold Layer**: Star schema with fact tables (domestic, inbound, outbound, industries, SDG) and dimension tables (country, indicator, year, unit of measure).  

---

## 📊 Integration Models

### Silver Layer Integration Model  

![Integration Model Silver](docs/Integration_Model_Silver.png)  

- Contains cleaned and standardized tourism and SDG datasets.  
- Each dataset retains **Country_code, Country, Indicator_code, and Units**.  
- Provides a unified and analysis-ready structure.  

### Gold Layer Integration Model  

![Integration Model Gold](docs/Integration_Model_Gold.png)  

- **Star Schema** design with Fact and Dimension views:  
  - **Dimensions**: Country, Indicator, Year, Unit of Measure.  
  - **Facts**: Domestic Tourism, Inbound Tourism, Outbound Tourism, Tourism Industries, SDG indicators.  
- Ensures referential integrity and supports analytical queries.

## 📂 Datasets

The datasets used in this project come from **Kaggle**:  
- [Original dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aritra100/global-tourism-statistics)  

I have applied minor modifications using Excel (delimiter changes from `,` to `;`) to make them compatible with SQL Server bulk insert operations.
